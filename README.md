# AnonyProof Protocol

> Privacy-first, decentralized identity verification without exposing sensitive data.

**AnonyProof** is a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based identity verification protocol designed to empower users to prove who they are — or that they are trustworthy — **without revealing any personal information** such as CPF, phone number, address or email.

---

## 🚀 What is AnonyProof?

AnonyProof allows users to validate themselves using cryptographic proofs instead of public or private identifiers. This removes the risk of social engineering, phishing, and data-based extortion.

It enables a safer digital world by combining:
- ✅ Decentralized identity principles
- 🔐 Blockchain-based verification
- 👻 GhostID: a user-friendly app interface
- 🧠 Future-ready ML and threat detection

| Backend        | Go (or Node.js)                                 |
| Frontend       | React (QR-based interaction)                    |
| Blockchain     | zkSync, Polygon, or Ethereum + Semaphore (ZKP) |
| Smart Contracts| Solidity                                        |
| Observability  | OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Loki                    |
| Hosting        | AWS (production) / Railway or Render (MVP)      |

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **Proof Issuer**: Validates the user once and creates a ZKP token
- **GhostID App**: Stores and manages the user's proof
- **Verifier Site**: Requests proof without storing or seeing personal data
- **Blockchain**: Stores immutable verification events (no PII)
- **ZKP Engine**: Generates and verifies anonymous identity proofs

## 👁️ Observability & Security

AnonyProof ships with full observability support:
- Structured logs
- Real-time tracing
- Custom metrics
- IP/geolocation tracking (for fraud detection)
- Future AI/ML module for anomaly and behavior scoring

## 📍 Real-World Problem

> "Anyone can buy your full name, phone number, and address for less than $5. That ends now."

AnonyProof was born out of frustration with how easily malicious actors can access our data — and how few tools we have to stay private and safe.

---

## 👻 GhostID Interface

GhostID is the user-facing wallet built on top of AnonyProof.  
It allows users to easily scan QR codes and prove their authenticity without revealing any personal info.

> Example flow:  
> User scans a QR → Proof generated via ZKP → Verifier receives confirmation ✅

## 📌 Roadmap

- [x] Define protocol architecture
- [x] Create project structure and observability stack
- [ ] Implement ZKP with Semaphore
- [ ] Connect smart contracts to zkSync testnet
- [ ] Build QR-based GhostID frontend
- [ ] Integrate logging, tracing and ML fraud layer
